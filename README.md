# NLR-reminder
This is a mod for the game garrys mod. It reminds people of the New Life Rule(DarkRP) and tells them when they can return to where they died. Its a very simple mod.
Place the file in the garrysmod/lua/autorun/server directory!
You can support me by followin me on github.
I am going to make much more and much bigger mod soon!
I wish you good luck with whatever you are planning!
